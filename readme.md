# Hi there :wave:

I'm a User Experience focused developer currently building great user experiences within the WordPress Block Editor as the Director of Editorial Engineering [@10up](https://github.com/10up). 

I contribute back to [@WordPress](https://github.com/WordPress) core whenever I can and am speaking atConferences & Meetups. 

My inboxes are always open and I'm happy to chat about all things WordPress, the Web, and User Experience :)
