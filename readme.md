# Hi there :wave:

I'm a User Experience focussed developer currently building great user experiences within the WordPress Block Editor as the Associate Director of Editorial Engineering [@10up](https://github.com/10up). 

I contribute back to [@WordPress](https://github.com/WordPress) core whenever I can and am speaking at WordCamps and WordPress Meetups. 

My inboxes are always open and I'm happy to chat about all things WordPress and User Experience :)
