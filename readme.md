# Hi there :wave:

I’m a user experience–focused developer passionate about crafting intuitive, delightful tools for the open web. Currently, I lead the editorial engineering practice at @10up/@fueled, where I help shape modern publishing experiences in the WordPress Block Editor.

I’m an active contributor to @WordPress core and a speaker at conferences and meetups, sharing insights on WordPress, editorial workflows, and user-centered design.

Always happy to connect, whether you want to talk about WordPress, the web platform, or how we can build better experiences for everyone.
